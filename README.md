# granturismotracker

Dockerized server application to track Gran Turismo (TM) time trial progress.

## Warning

It's a little rough around the edges, especially the administrator interface.

Also, without further modification it will probably only start up properly on Linux host machines.

It's MIT-licensed though, so do whatever you want with it.

## Usage

After cloning the repository, simply execute *deploy.sh* to bring up the container at *0.0.0.0:9999* using docker-compose.
